Each module should go in its own file, with an extension of .ex.   
(You can put more than one module in a file, but keep it simple while getting started.)   
You should use name_of_module.ex, where name_of_module is the lowercase version of the module name you specify inside of the module file.   

example : a file named drop.ex. That file looked

      defmodule Drop do
        ..
      end
